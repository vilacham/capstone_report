# Capstone Report

This is my final project of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. My initial idea was to create a model to predict the winner of NBA matches based on the teams performance on their last game or games. The objectives of the project are to create a model that has a reasonable accuracy hen predicting the winner and to determine how many of the last games of the teams must be considered when trying to predict a result based in the teams performances.

I wrote the codes in Python. Instructions to download and install Python can be found in https://www.python.org/downloads/.

I also used Jupyter Notebook to help me throughout the project. Instructions to download and install Jupyter Notebook can be found in http://jupyter.org/install.

The proposal for this capstone project can be found in https://github.com/vilacham/mlnd_capstone_proposal/blob/master/proposal.pdf.
